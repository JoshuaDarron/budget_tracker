# üìä Google Drive Template Automation

A Python automation tool that copies a monthly Google Sheets template into a year-based folder structure within your Google Drive. It intelligently creates the folder for the year (if it doesn't exist), copies the template, renames it based on the previous month (e.g., `01`, `02`, ...), and cleans up unnecessary rows.

## ‚ú® Description

This tool automates the monthly creation of Google Sheets based on a reusable `Template` file stored in your Google Drive. On execution, it:

- Finds or creates a folder named after the **previous month's year** (e.g., `2024`).
- Copies the `Template` file from the **parent directory**.
- Renames the new file with the **previous month number** (e.g., `03` for March).
- Deletes:
  - Rows 1‚Äì6 on the first sheet
  - Row 1 on the second sheet

This is perfect for recurring reports, logs, or budgeting workflows.
